We build the application over multiple iterations. 
With each iteration, we gradually improve the application. 
The goal of this multiple iteration approach is to enable you to understand the reason for each change.

    Iteration #1 - Create the application. In the first iteration, we create the Contact Manager in the simplest 
                    way possible. We add support for basic database operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD).
    Iteration #2 - Make the application look nice. In this iteration, we improve the appearance of the application 
                    by modifying the default ASP.NET MVC view master page and cascading style sheet.
    Iteration #3 - Add form validation. In the third iteration, we add basic form validation. We prevent people 
                    from submitting a form without completing required form fields. We also validate email addresses 
                    and phone numbers.
    Iteration #4 - Make the application loosely coupled. In this third iteration, we take advantage of several 
                    software design patterns to make it easier to maintain and modify the Contact Manager application.
                    For example, we refactor our application to use the Repository pattern and the Dependency 
                    Injection pattern.
    Iteration #5 - Create unit tests. In the fifth iteration, we make our application easier to maintain and modify 
                    by adding unit tests. We mock our data model classes and build unit tests for our controllers 
                    and validation logic.
    Iteration #6 - Use test-driven development. In this sixth iteration, we add new functionality to our application 
                    by writing unit tests first and writing code against the unit tests. In this iteration, we add 
                    contact groups.
    Iteration #7 - Add Ajax functionality. In the seventh iteration, we improve the responsiveness and performance of 
                    our application by adding support for Ajax.
